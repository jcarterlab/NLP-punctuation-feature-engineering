# NLP-punctuation-feature-engineering

This notebook looks at how to optimize punctuation feature engineering for a Kaggle essay scoring competition. It turns out that using a count of all punctuation types can reduce effectiveness by adding unnecessary noise. In this case, using only the 3 types of punctuation with the strongest correlation to essays scores proved most effective.
